### Tuesday, Jan 6 - Day 6
**Topic:** Closures & Scope
**Sessions:** 2

#### Session 1: Lexical Scope & Closures (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. What is "scope" in JavaScript?
2. What is a closure?

- What is a closure
- How closures "remember" their environment

**Resources:**
- [JavaScript.info: Closure](https://javascript.info/closure) (20 min - READ CAREFULLY)

**Exercises:**
```javascript
// 1. Predict the output:
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // ?
console.log(counter()); // ?
console.log(counter()); // ?

// 2. Create a function that generates greeting functions:
// const greetJohn = createGreeter("John");
// greetJohn("Hello"); // "Hello, John!"

// 3. Explain why this logs 3, 3, 3:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
// Fix it to log 0, 1, 2
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. Define "closure" in one sentence.
2. Why do closures exist? What problem do they solve?
3. What does "lexical scope" mean?

---

#### Session 2: Practical Closure Patterns (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. How can closures create "private" variables?
2. What is a factory function?

**Core Topics:**
- Private variables pattern
- Factory functions
- Module pattern
- Memoization with closures

**Exercises:**
```javascript
// 1. Create a counter factory with private state:
function createCounter() {
  // Return object with: increment(), decrement(), getValue()
  // The count should NOT be accessible directly
}

// 2. Create a createIdGenerator that returns unique IDs:
// const userIdGen = createIdGenerator("user");
// userIdGen(); // "user_1"
// userIdGen(); // "user_2"

// 3. Create a simple memoize function:
function memoize(fn) {
  // Returns a function that caches results
}
const expensiveSquare = memoize((n) => {
  console.log("Computing...");
  return n * n;
});
expensiveSquare(5); // "Computing..." then 25
expensiveSquare(5); // Just 25 (cached!)

// 4. Create a once() function that only allows fn to run once:
const initialize = once(() => console.log("Initialized!"));
initialize(); // "Initialized!"
initialize(); // Nothing happens
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. How do closures enable private variables?

```typescript
// Primitive types
let name: string = "Sebastian";
let age: number = 25;
let isActive: boolean = true;
let nothing: null = null;

}
let userRole: Role = Role.User;

// Any (avoid this!)
let anything: any = "could be anything";
anything = 42;
anything = true;

// Unknown (safer than any)
let userInput: unknown;
userInput = 5;

- Intersection types (`&`)
- Literal types
- Type narrowing

**Create src/types.ts:**
```typescript
// Type alias for primitives
type ID = string | number;
type Email = string;

// Union types
type Status = "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
let orderStatus: Status = "pending";
// orderStatus = "cancelled"; // Error!

// Type alias for objects
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};

// Intersection types (&) - combine types
type Timestamped = {
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
};

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

type TimestampedUser = User & Timestamped;

const user: TimestampedUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Sebastian",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
};

// Union with objects
type SuccessResponse = {
  success: true;
  data: any;
};

type ErrorResponse = {
  success: false;
  error: string;
};

type ApiResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse;

// Type narrowing
function handleResponse(response: ApiResponse) {
  if (response.success) {
    console.log(response.data); // TS knows it's SuccessResponse
  } else {
    console.log(response.error); // TS knows it's ErrorResponse
  }
}

// Discriminated unions (tagged unions)
type Circle = {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
};

type Square = {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
};

type Rectangle = {
  kind: "rectangle";
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

type Shape = Circle | Square | Rectangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    case "rectangle":
      return shape.width * shape.height;
  }
}

// Type guards
function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string";
}

function processValue(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    return value.toUpperCase();
  } else {
    return value.toFixed(2);
  }
}
```

**Exercises:**
1. Create a type `UserRole` with literal types: "admin" | "user" | "guest"
2. Create types for HTTP methods: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE"
3. Create a `Result<T>` type that's either `{ ok: true, value: T }` or `{ ok: false, error: string }`
4. Create types for different payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal, BankTransfer) using discriminated unions
5. Write a type guard function `isValidEmail(value: unknown): value is string`

**Interface vs Type - When to use what:**
```typescript
// Use INTERFACE when:
// - Defining object shapes
// - You might extend it later
// - Working with classes

// Use TYPE when:
// - Union types
// - Intersection types
// - Mapped types
// - Function types
// - Anything that's not an object
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. What's a union type?
2. What's an intersection type?
3. What are literal types?
4. Explain type narrowing.

  console.log(item.length);
}

logLength("hello"); // OK - string has length
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // OK - array has length
logLength({ length: 10 }); // OK - object has length
// logLength(42); // Error! number doesn't have length

// Generic interface
interface Box<T> {
  value: T;
}

const stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "hello" };
const numberBox: Box<number> = { value: 42 };

// Generic type
type Result<T> = {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
};

const userResult: Result<User> = {
  success: true,
  data: { id: 1, name: "Sebastian" }
};

// Generic class
class DataStore<T> {
  private data: T[] = [];

  add(item: T): void {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  getAll(): T[] {
    return [...this.data];
  }

  find(predicate: (item: T) => boolean): T | undefined {
    return this.data.find(predicate);
  }
}

const numberStore = new DataStore<number>();
numberStore.add(1);
numberStore.add(2);

const userStore = new DataStore<User>();
userStore.add({ id: 1, name: "John" });

// Generic constraints with keyof
function getProperty<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const user = { id: 1, name: "Sebastian", age: 25 };
const userName = getProperty(user, "name"); // string

#### Session 2: Utility Types (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. What are utility types?
2. Name 3 built-in TypeScript utility types.

**Core Topics:**
- `Partial<T>`
- `Required<T>`
- `Readonly<T>`
- `Pick<T, K>`
- `Omit<T, K>`
- `Record<K, T>`
- `ReturnType<T>`
- `Parameters<T>`

**Create src/utility-types.ts:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
  password: string;
}

// Partial - makes all properties optional
type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
const updateData: PartialUser = {
  name: "New Name"
  // Other fields are optional
};

// Required - makes all properties required
interface OptionalUser {
  id?: number;
  name?: string;
}
type RequiredUser = Required<OptionalUser>;
// Now id and name are required

// Readonly - makes all properties readonly
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
const user: ReadonlyUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  age: 25,
  password: "secret"
};
// user.name = "Jane"; // Error!

// Pick - select specific properties
type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name" | "email">;
// Has only: id, name, email

// Omit - exclude specific properties
type UserWithoutPassword = Omit<User, "password">;
// Has all except password

type PublicUser = Omit<User, "password" | "email">;
// Has only: id, name, age

// Record - create object type with specific keys and value type
type UserRoles = Record<string, string[]>;
const roles: UserRoles = {
  admin: ["read", "write", "delete"],
  user: ["read"],
  guest: []
};

type HttpStatusCodes = Record<number, string>;
const statusMessages: HttpStatusCodes = {
  200: "OK",
  404: "Not Found",
  500: "Internal Server Error"
};

// ReturnType - extract return type of function
function getUser() {
  return { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@example.com" };
}
type UserType = ReturnType<typeof getUser>;
// Same as: { id: number; name: string; email: string }

// Parameters - extract parameter types
function createUser(name: string, age: number, email: string) {
  return { name, age, email };
}
type CreateUserParams = Parameters<typeof createUser>;
// [string, number, string]

// Awaited - unwrap Promise type
type AsyncUser = Promise<User>;
type UnwrappedUser = Awaited<AsyncUser>;
// Same as User

// NonNullable - remove null and undefined
type MaybeString = string | null | undefined;
type DefinitelyString = NonNullable<MaybeString>;
// string

// Combining utility types
type UserDTO = Omit<User, "password" | "id"> & {
  confirmPassword: string;
};

type UpdateUserDTO = Partial<Omit<User, "id" | "password">>;
```

**Exercises:**
1. Create a `CreatePostDTO` that omits `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` from Post
2. Create a `PartialUpdate<T>` generic that makes all properties optional except `id`
3. Create `Config` object using Record with keys: "apiUrl", "timeout", "retries" (all strings)
4. Extract the return type of: `async function fetchUsers() { return [{ id: 1, name: "John" }]; }`
5. Create a type that represents all keys of User as strings: "id" | "name" | "email" ...

**Hints:**
- Hint 1: Use Omit<Post, "id" | "createdAt" | "updatedAt">
- Hint 2: Combine Partial and Required
- Hint 3: Record<"key1" | "key2", string>
- Hint 4: Use ReturnType<typeof fn> then Awaited
- Hint 5: Use keyof User

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. What does Partial do?
2. What's the difference between Pick and Omit?
3. When would you use Record?

  }
  
  res.json(user);
});

// Type query parameters
interface UserQuery {
  name?: string;
  limit?: string;
}

app.get('/search', (req: Request<{}, {}, {}, UserQuery>, res: Response) => {

const authMiddleware = (req: AuthRequest, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });
  }
  
  // Fake auth - just set userId
  req.userId = 1;
  next();
};

app.get('/profile', authMiddleware, (req: AuthRequest, res: Response) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === req.userId);
  res.json(user);

  error: string;
  status: number;
}

app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  const response: ErrorResponse = {
    error: err.message,
    status: 500
  };
  res.status(500).json(response);

// Mapped types
type ReadonlyProps<T> = {
  readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

type ReadonlyUser = ReadonlyProps<User>;
// All properties are readonly

// Make all properties optional
type Optional<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]?: T[K];
};

// Make all properties nullable
type Nullable<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] | null;
};

// Conditional types
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
type A = IsString<string>; // true
type B = IsString<number>; // false

// More practical conditional type
type NonNullableProps<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: NonNullable<T[K]>;
};

// Infer keyword
type GetReturnType<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

### Monday, Feb 2 - Day 33
**Topic:** TypeScript Basic Types
**Sessions:** 2

#### Session 1: Primitive Types (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. What types does TypeScript add to JavaScript?
2. What is type inference?

**Core Topics:**
- Type annotations
- Type inference
- Primitive types: string, number, boolean
- Arrays: `number[]` vs `Array<number>`
- Special types: any, unknown, void, never, null, undefined

**Resources:**
- [TypeScript Handbook - Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) (20 min)
- [Total TypeScript Beginners](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript) - START HERE

**Setup:**
```bash
mkdir ts-practice && cd ts-practice
npm init -y
npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node
npx tsc --init
```

**Exercises:**
```typescript
// 1. Type annotations
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 25;
let isActive: boolean = true;

// 2. Arrays
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let strings: Array<string> = ["a", "b", "c"];

// 3. What happens if you do this?
let value: string = 42; // Error!

// 4. Type inference - what type is this?
let inferred = "hello"; // TypeScript knows it's a string

// 5. When to use any? (Answer: almost never!)
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. What's the difference between `number[]` and `Array<number>`?
2. What is type inference?
3. Why should you avoid `any`?

---

#### Session 2: Functions & Object Types (50 min)
**Core Topics:**
- Function parameter types
- Return types
- Optional parameters
- Default parameters
- Object type annotations

**Exercises:**
```typescript
// 1. Type a function
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// 2. Optional parameter
function greet(name: string, greeting?: string): string {
  return `${greeting || "Hello"}, ${name}!`;
}

// 3. Default parameter
function createUser(name: string, role: string = "user"): object {
  return { name, role };
}

// 4. Object type
function printUser(user: { name: string; age: number }): void {
  console.log(`${user.name} is ${user.age}`);
}

// 5. Arrow function types
const multiply: (a: number, b: number) => number = (a, b) => a * b;
```

**Commit:** `Day 33: TypeScript basic types`

### Tuesday, Feb 3 - Day 34
**Topic:** Interfaces & Type Aliases
**Sessions:** 2

#### Session 1: Interfaces (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. What is an interface?
2. How do interfaces help with code quality?

**Core Topics:**
- Interface syntax
- Optional properties (`?`)
- Readonly properties
- Extending interfaces

**Resources:**
- [TypeScript Handbook - Object Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html) (15 min)

**Exercises:**
```typescript
// 1. Basic interface
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number; // optional
  readonly createdAt: Date; // readonly
}

// 2. Use the interface
const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John",
  email: "john@example.com",
  createdAt: new Date()
};

// 3. Extending interfaces
interface Admin extends User {
  permissions: string[];
}

// 4. Array of interfaces
const users: User[] = [];

// 5. Interface for function
interface MathFunc {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
const add: MathFunc = (a, b) => a + b;
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. How do you make a property optional?
2. How do you make a property readonly?
3. How do you extend an interface?

---

#### Session 2: Type Aliases & Union Types (50 min)
**Core Topics:**
- Type aliases (`type`)
- Union types (`|`)
- Intersection types (`&`)
- Literal types
- Type narrowing

**Exercises:**
```typescript
// 1. Type alias
type ID = string | number;
type Status = "pending" | "completed" | "cancelled";

// 2. Union types
function printId(id: string | number): void {
  console.log(id);
}

// 3. Type narrowing
function process(value: string | number): string {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    return value.toUpperCase(); // TS knows it's a string here
  }
  return value.toString();
}

// 4. Intersection types
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };
type Staff = Person & Employee;

// 5. Interface vs Type - when to use each?
// Interface: for objects, can extend, declaration merging
// Type: for unions, intersections, primitives
```

**Commit:** `Day 34: Interfaces and type aliases`

### Wednesday, Feb 4 - Day 35
**Topic:** Generics
**Sessions:** 2

#### Session 1: Generic Functions (50 min)

- Generic syntax `<T>`
- Generic functions
- Multiple type parameters
- Generic constraints

**Resources:**
- [TypeScript Handbook - Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) (20 min)

**Exercises:**
```typescript
// 1. Generic function
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
identity<string>("hello"); // T is string
identity(42); // T inferred as number

// 2. Generic with arrays
function getFirst<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0];
}

// 3. Multiple type parameters
function pair<T, U>(first: T, second: U): [T, U] {
  return [first, second];
}

// 4. Generic constraint
function getLength<T extends { length: number }>(item: T): number {
  return item.length;
}
getLength("hello"); // OK
getLength([1, 2, 3]); // OK
// getLength(123); // Error! number doesn't have length
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. What does `<T>` mean?
2. How do you constrain a generic type?
3. Write a generic `getFirst` function from memory.

---

#### Session 2: Generic Interfaces & Utility Types (50 min)
**Core Topics:**
- Generic interfaces
- Generic classes
- Utility types: `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, `Required`

**Exercises:**

// 1. Generic interface
interface Box<T> {
  value: T;
}
const stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "hello" };

// 2. Generic interface for API response
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: number;
  message: string;
}

// 3. Utility types
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

type PartialUser = Partial<User>; // All properties optional
type UserWithoutPassword = Omit<User, "password">;
type UserCredentials = Pick<User, "email" | "password">;

// 4. Record type
type UserRoles = Record<string, string[]>;
const roles: UserRoles = {
  admin: ["read", "write", "delete"],
  user: ["read"]
};

// 5. Create your own generic type
type Result<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: string };
```
