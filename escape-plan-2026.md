## Your Situation & Mission

### Current Reality
**Work:** 8am-5pm, HCL Domino/LotusScript/Formula (legacy stack)
- JS in HTML, bad practices everywhere
- No documentation, high stress
- Limited learning opportunities
- Dead-end technology
- **Intern contract ends July 14, 2026**

### Time Commitment
**Session Structure:** 50 minutes coding + 10 minutes rest = 1 session

| Day | Sessions | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| Monday | 2 sessions | ~2 hours |
| Tuesday | 2 sessions | ~2 hours |
| Wednesday | 2 sessions | ~2 hours |
| Thursday | 2 sessions | ~2 hours |
| Friday | 2 sessions | ~2 hours |
| Saturday | 4 sessions | ~4 hours |
| Sunday | 4 sessions | ~4 hours |
| **Weekly Total** | **18 sessions** | **~18 hours** |

**Total Duration:** 28 weeks (~504 hours, ~504 sessions)

### Mission Statement
**Escape legacy tech hell. Become a hireable modern developer by July 14, 2026.**

### Core Principles
1. **NO AI CODE GENERATION.** Use AI as mentor only after 15 minutes of struggle.
2. **Transferable skills > Framework knowledge.** Algorithms and problem-solving last forever.
3. **Build real projects.** Portfolio speaks louder than certificates.
4. **50-10 sessions.** Focused bursts with intentional rest.
5. **No zero days.** Even 10 minutes keeps the streak alive.

### Success Definition
**By July 14, 2026:**
- ✅ Master modern JavaScript (ES6+) + TypeScript
- ✅ Build full-stack apps (React + NestJS)
- ✅ Understand Docker containerization
- ✅ Know Redis basics (caching)
- ✅ Solve 50+ algorithm problems (LeetCode)
- ✅ 5+ portfolio projects deployed
- ✅ Pass technical interviews confidently
- ✅ Have job offers OR strong interview pipeline

### Tuesday, Jan 6 - Day 6
**Topic:** Closures & Scope
**Sessions:** 2

#### Session 1: Lexical Scope & Closures (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. What is "scope" in JavaScript?
2. What is a closure?

**Core Topics:**

- What is a closure
- How closures "remember" their environment

**Resources:**
- [JavaScript.info: Closure](https://javascript.info/closure) (20 min - READ CAREFULLY)

**Exercises:**
```javascript
// 1. Predict the output:
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // ?
console.log(counter()); // ?
console.log(counter()); // ?

// 2. Create a function that generates greeting functions:
// const greetJohn = createGreeter("John");
// greetJohn("Hello"); // "Hello, John!"

// 3. Explain why this logs 3, 3, 3:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100);
}
// Fix it to log 0, 1, 2
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. Define "closure" in one sentence.
2. Why do closures exist? What problem do they solve?
3. What does "lexical scope" mean?

---

#### Session 2: Practical Closure Patterns (50 min)
**Pre-Session Questions:**
1. How can closures create "private" variables?
2. What is a factory function?

**Core Topics:**
- Private variables pattern
- Factory functions
- Module pattern
- Memoization with closures

**Exercises:**
```javascript
// 1. Create a counter factory with private state:
function createCounter() {
  // Return object with: increment(), decrement(), getValue()
  // The count should NOT be accessible directly
}

// 2. Create a createIdGenerator that returns unique IDs:
// const userIdGen = createIdGenerator("user");
// userIdGen(); // "user_1"
// userIdGen(); // "user_2"

// 3. Create a simple memoize function:
function memoize(fn) {
  // Returns a function that caches results
}
const expensiveSquare = memoize((n) => {
  console.log("Computing...");
  return n * n;
});
expensiveSquare(5); // "Computing..." then 25
expensiveSquare(5); // Just 25 (cached!)

// 4. Create a once() function that only allows fn to run once:
const initialize = once(() => console.log("Initialized!"));
initialize(); // "Initialized!"
initialize(); // Nothing happens
```

**Post-Session Recall:**
1. How do closures enable private variables?
2. Write a simple counter factory from memory.
3. What's the memoization pattern? Why is it useful?

function delay(ms) {
  // Return a Promise that resolves after ms milliseconds
}

// 4. Create a Promise that rejects if a number is negative:

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Your code
  });
}
```

  email: "john@example.com",
  createdAt: new Date()
};

// 3. Extending interfaces
interface Admin extends User {
  permissions: string[];
}

  console.log(id);
}

// 3. Type narrowing
function process(value: string | number): string {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    return value.toUpperCase(); // TS knows it's a string here
  }
  return value.toString();
}

// 4. Intersection types
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };
type Staff = Person & Employee;

// 5. Interface vs Type - when to use each?
// Interface: for objects, can extend, declaration merging
// Type: for unions, intersections, primitives
