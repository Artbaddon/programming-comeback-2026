# Progress Log - January 2026

## Week 1 (Jan 1 - Jan 5)

### Thursday, Jan 1 - Day 1
**Goal:** Modern JS Core - Variables refresh
**Status:** [~] Partial
**Sessions:** 1/2 (weekday)
**Time:** 20 minutes

**Notes:**
- Revisited why `let`/`const` exist and typed a short reminder snippet to keep the streak alive.
- Realized I still blur hoisting with variable types, so I marked it for follow-up tomorrow.
- Habit win: even a single line keeps momentum better than skipping entirely.

**Commits:**
- docs: log week 1 day 1 progress
